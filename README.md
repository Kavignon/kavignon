### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kevin Avignon, and I am a software developer based in Montreal, Canada. I currently sit as one of the board members of the F# Software Foundation (FSSF).

I've worked with .NET, both educationally and professionally, since 2013. I dabble in different things such as 
- Developing a suite of [Roslyn analyzers meant to analyze and advise on your use of collections and LINQ APIs](https://github.com/hypertherm/DotNet.SystemCollections.Analyzers).
- Developing ASP.NET Core web applications with C# & F#.
- Exploring frontend development with React & Typescript.

You can find a list below of what I'm currently focused on:
- Following along the book 'Building Git' from James Coglan with [Python](https://github.com/Kavignon/Gallifrey).
- Going through [Epic React](https://epicreact.dev/) from Kent C Dodds.
- Handling both backend (ASP.NET/F#) and frontend (React/TS) at work
- I write posts on [my technical blog](https://kevinavignon.com/) from time to time.
