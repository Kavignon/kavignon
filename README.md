### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kevin Avignon, and I am a functional software developer based in Montreal, Canada.

I have worked with F# for about 2-3 years now! Using F# is one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had with coding. And the simplicity amazes me. Usually when I get bugs, through the use of the language, the strictness of the type system and the compiler, it doesn't take too much time to figure out the culprit. 

When I don't work with F#, I mainly work with C# which I have used for over about 7 years now. I dabbl in different things in .NET such as 
- Developing automatic code analysis and fixing through metaprogramming with the Roslyn compiler
- Maintaining WPF desktop apps with C# & XAML
- Developping ASP.NET Core web applications with C# & F#
- Exploring frontend development with React, F# & Javascript
- Supporting DevOps infrastructure with PowerShell

Currently, I am focused on furthering my functional programming skills by doing the following:
- Creating an education environment for newcomers to learn about F# in an interactive environment with .NET Interactive.
- Building my React knowledge from the ground up with the course bundle 'Epic React Pro'.
- Implementing fantasy game as a text-adventure with React & F#.
- Leading a web application at work where the backend is done through F#.
