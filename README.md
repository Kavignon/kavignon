### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kevin Avignon, and I am a functional software developer based in Montreal, Canada. I have worked with F# for about 2-3 years now! Using F# is one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had with software development. Its simplicity amazes me. Usually, when I get bugs, through the use of the language, the strictness of the type system and the compiler, it doesn't take too much time to figure out the culprit. 

When I don't work with F#, I work with C# which I have used for about 7 years now. I dabble in different things in .NET such as 
- Developing automatic code analysis and fixing through metaprogramming & the Roslyn compiler.
- Maintaining WPF desktop apps with C# & XAML.
- Developing ASP.NET Core web applications with C# & F#.
- Exploring frontend development with React, F# & Javascript.
- Supporting DevOps infrastructure with PowerShell.

You can find a list below of what I'm currently focused on:

- Creating an educational environment for newcomers to learn about F#. The environment will be interactive and implemented with .NET Interactive.
- Building my React knowledge from the ground up with the course bundle 'Epic React Pro'.
- Implementing a fantasy game as a text-adventure with React & F#.
- Leading a web application at work where the backend is done through F#.
