### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kevin Avignon, and I am a software developer based in Montreal, Canada. I have worked with F# for about 3 years now! Using F# is one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had with software development. Its simplicity amazes me. Usually, when I get bugs, through the use of the language, the strictness of the type system and the compiler, it doesn't take too much time to figure out the culprit. 

When I don't work with F#, I work with C# which I have used for about 7 years now. I dabble in different things in .NET such as 
- Developing a suite of [Roslyn analyzers meant to analyze and advise on your use of collections and LINQ APIs](https://github.com/hypertherm/DotNet.SystemCollections.Analyzers).
- Developing ASP.NET Core web applications with C# & F#.
- Exploring frontend development with React, F# & Javascript.

You can find a list below of what I'm currently focused on:
- Implementing a [distributed system](https://github.com/Kavignon/FSSF-Mentorship-Planner) in charge of organizing and automating the [F# mentorship program](https://fsharp.org/mentorship/) provided by [F# Software Foundation](https://foundation.fsharp.org/).
- Implementing a [2D Tactical MMORPG](https://github.com/Soul-Tactics) inspired by games such as Dofus or Final Fantasy Tactics through Typescript, React, WebGL, Unity3D, C# and Rust.
- I write posts on [my technical blog](https://kevinavignon.com/) from time to time.
