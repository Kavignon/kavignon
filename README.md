### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kevin Avignon, and I am a senior software developer based in Montreal, Canada. 
I used to be a board member for the [F# Software Foundation (FSSF)](https://fsharp.org/mentorship/). I led for 2 years the educative efforts for our international mentorship program and over that time, I had community members engaged with me as we built a [platform to do match making between applicants (mentors/mentees)](https://github.com/Kavignon/FSharp-Mentorship-Automatic-Planner).

You can find a list below of what I'm currently focused on:
- Exploring Elixir/Phoenix/LiveView as I'm writing the online book [Beware of Dragons in the dungeons](https://github.com/Beware-of-dragons/MUD_book)
- I write posts on [my technical blog](https://kevinavignon.com/) from time to time.
